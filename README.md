# Sabre Wulf Team Project 2020

## Game Idea
There are *dark* times ahead and there is only one way to escape it: Run!
Which is easier said than done when you can only see a small part of the world around you. But luckily you have friends who can see what you cannot.

## Running The Game
Simply run sabrewulf-all.jar
